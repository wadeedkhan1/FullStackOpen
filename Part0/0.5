Explanation:

The user accesses the SPA version of the notes app.
The SPA is loaded, and its initialization phase begins.
The SPA checks the user's authentication status.
  If authenticated, it proceeds to fetch notes data.
  If not authenticated, it shows the login page.
The SPA checks the network connection.
  If connected, it sends a GET request to the server for notes data.
  If not connected, an error is shown to the user.
On a successful server response, the SPA renders the notes.
  If there's an error, it is shown to the user.
